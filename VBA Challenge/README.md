# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project 
Although the VBA code works well for a dozen stocks,Steve  wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years and it may take a long time to execute so in this project i am refactoring  code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that was done before . 
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to help Refactoring the solution provided to Steve to maake it more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory so Steve can  analyse the  stock market over the last few years 

## Results
Compared to 2017,only ENPH and RUn did well in 2018.Only TERP didnt do well in 2017.The total volumes traded in 2018 for most shares were lesser than in 2017.

      When using refactored code,the excution time is lesser when  compared to non refactored code(Original code).

### Summary
Advantages
The goal of refactoring is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior.Refactoring improves the design of software, makes software easier to understand, helps us find bugs and also helps in executing the program faster.
Disadvantages
The disadvantage of refactoring code is that we might have to retest lots of functionality in the code.
